  Daisuke Kanbe is an anime character in the series
"The Millionare Detective Balance: Unlimited"
Currently he is one of my favorite anime guys,but of course the
series is only had two episodes, 
so my opinion might change. </div> 
<div id="two">
<br><br>
Daisuke has been assained to the modern crime prevention task force in Japan <br> for a reason unknown at the moment.
He has a sister, <br> Suzue Kanbe who sometimes assists him in detecteve work when asked.
<br> One of the most noticables things about Daisuke is that he has money, a <em> <strong> LOT </strong> </em>
of it.<br> It is said that he has an unlimited balance in his account (which would explain the name). 
<br> He relies heavily on his money while doing dectective work, something that
<br>Haru Kato, another main character,<strong> Hates</strong>.

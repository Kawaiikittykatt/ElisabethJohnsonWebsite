<h2>
Hi! I'm Elisabeth Johnson. <br> I'm a freshman at the University of Arkansas studing Computer science. I'll be mainly using this website as a way to document personal projects, and some other things I'm passionate about. <br> </h2>

<h2> <strong> A little about me:  </strong> </h2>

<div id = "aboutme">
<h2>
I was apart of the Computer Science Magnet at my Highschool, So I've taken many classes on coding, and used those skills in Coding Competitions. I have used C++, Java, and Python the most, though I do know a little C and JavaScript. <br> <br>
I love rock climbing, I've been climbing for a little over 8 years, It's a super great way to exercise and execute problem solving skills. <br> <br>
I'm the type of person to pick up hobbies easily, but some of the things I'm most passionate about include: 
<ul>
<li> The moon, Space and Constellations </li>
<li> Fantasy Novels </li>
<li> Fashion  </li>
<li> Music </li>
</ul> 
So most of my projects will revolve around some of these topics.
